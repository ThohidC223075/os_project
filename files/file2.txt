 Why Your Idea Is Strong
✅ Real-World Problem:
Bank and mobile banking customers face difficulties getting clear information.

Long wait times, call costs, and misinformation are common.

Bank staff are overwhelmed handling repetitive queries.

✅ Proposed Solution:
Use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI chatbot trained on bank PDFs (rules, documents, services).

Automatically answers user queries.

Escalates to human agent if unsure.

Saves time, reduces cost, improves service.
